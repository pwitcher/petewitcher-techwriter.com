I'm a technical writer with over 20 years of experience documenting retail and enterprise products of varying technical complexity. I enjoy the challenge of learning new applications and technologies, and I love writing about them to let others appreciate them as well.

Before becoming a technical writer, I was a copywriter, a slot machine salesman, a call center supervisor, and I had many other jobs in my teens and twenties. I'm also an amateur musician. I sing and play acoustic guitar in my solo act, and I'm lead singer and rhythm guitarist in a blues/rock cover band. I also donate  time each month performing live acoustic music for residents at assisted living and memory care facilities.

I've been married for 30 years and I have three kids. I enjoy traveling, hiking, and camping with my family, as well as snowboarding, fishing, riding ATVs, cooking, playing video games, and landscaping.

And finally, let it be known that my name (**Peter Witcher**) can be rearranged to spell **Tech Writer**  (with e and p left over).
