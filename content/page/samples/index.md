# Some examples of my work
You can browse some documents I wrote and co-wrote below. I also provide custom samples on request.

### [Sample #1 - Open API documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/pwitcher/SongbookApi/1.0.0)
Most of the API documentation I've done is proprietary and internal-only, so I created and hosted my own simple RESTful web API. Then I documented it with SwaggerHub to provide that as a sample.

#### Tools used
- Python
- Flask
- SwaggerHub
- OAS
- Git/Github
- Heroku
- Atom
- WinSCP

### Sample #2 - Distributed Cloud Service Documentation
**[Overview](https://www.volterra.io/docs/services/mesh/bot-defense)**  
**[How-to](https://www.volterra.io/docs/how-to/advanced-security/bot-defense)**  
These documents describe Distributed Cloud Bot Defense, an online bot detection and mitigation service provided by F5 via their Distributed Cloud platform. I created this content on short notice and worked closely with another tech writer to learn a new publishing workflow using Gitlab and Jenkins. When the project was complete, the Product Manager recognized my work publicly and said I was one of the best tech writers she had ever worked with.

#### Tools used
- Atom
- Git/Gitlab
- Photoshop

### [Sample #3 - Integrated Bot Defense Knowledge base articles](https://f5cloudservices.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/1500000490201-Integrated-Bot-Defense)
I wrote these KB articles for Integrated Bot Defense, an F5 bot detection and mitigation solution provided via their BIG-IP platform. Almost all the content is my original writing. The [Configuration Guide](https://f5cloudservices.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005614802-Integrated-Bot-Defense-Configuration-Guide-for-BIG-IP) already existed in previous articles, so I copied it, updated it, and added new screenshots to support the new product.

#### Tools used
- Zendesk
- Flare
- Git/Github
- Photoshop

**Note:** Zendesk allows multiple users to edit articles. The KB articles above may contain edits from support engineers and other technical writers.

### [Sample #4 - Hardware owner\'s manual (retail)](sample_UsersManualRetail2.pdf)
This guide documents a guitar signal processor. The audience is retail consumers. This guide was provided as hard copy and PDF. I created all the content for this project, including the text and graphics (except the cover art).

#### Tools used
- InDesign
- Photoshop
- Illustrator
