# Some examples of my work
Over the course of my career I've been an individual contributor and I've been a manager. During my eight years as a manager, I contributed as a writer or co-writer on several occasions. I'm happy to provide custom  samples if you would like  see something written from scratch.

**Note:** Layout and design decisions were almost always determined by groups outside of my tech writing team (Marketing, for example), so I take no credit for look and feel.


### [Sample #1 - Open API documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/pwitcher/SongbookApi/1.0.0)
Most of the API and OAS documentation I've done is proprietary and internal-only, so I consulted several tutorials to create and host my own simple RESTful web API. Then I documented it to provide that documentation as a sample.

#### Tools used
- Python
- Flask
- SwaggerHub
- OAS
- Git/Github
- Heroku
- Atom
- WinSCP

### [Sample #2 - Internal API guide](APIGuideSSD.pdf)
This guide documents an API for monitoring and managing a 3U SSD storage device. I was a co-writer on this. The project was interesting to me because the API uses a RESTful web service to manage hardware devices. It's one of the first API documents I worked on. SanDisk did not provide an HTML version of this documentation; it was distributed as PDF only.

#### Tools used
- Flare
- Photoshop
- Illustrator

### [Sample #3 - Knowledge base articles](https://f5cloudservices.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/1500000490201-Integrated-Bot-Defense)
I wrote these KB articles for Integrated Bot Defense, an F5 bot detection and mitigation solution. Almost all the content is my original writing. Some content (for example, the [Configuration Guide](https://f5cloudservices.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005614802-Integrated-Bot-Defense-Configuration-Guide-for-BIG-IP)) already existed in previous articles, so I copied it, updated it, and added new screenshots to support the new product.

#### Tools used
- Zendesk
- Flare
- Git/Github

**Note:** Zendesk allows many users to edit articles. The KB articles above may contain edits from other people.

### [Sample #4 - Hardware user\'s guide (retail)](sample_UsersManualRetail2.pdf)
This guide documents a guitar signal processor. The audience is retail consumers. This guide was provided as hard copy and PDF. I created all the content for this project, including the text and graphics (except the cover art).

#### Tools used
- InDesign
- Photoshop
- Illustrator
