# API Documentation Sample


I've documented different types of APIs, including **web service APIs**, **software APIs**, and **hardware APIs**.

[API documentation sample](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/pwitcher/SongbookApi/1.0.0)


The web service APIs I've documented are all proprietary and not available for distribution as samples. So to demonstrate my web API documentation skills, I created my own public web API using Python and Flask, hosted it on Heroku, and documented it according to the Open API Specification using SwaggerHub.

Here are two samples of API guides for storage devices I worked on:

[IF150 RESTful API Guide](./resources/_gen/images/API Guide - SSD.pdf)

[NVMKV API Library](resources\_gen\images\API Guide - storage devices.pdf)
