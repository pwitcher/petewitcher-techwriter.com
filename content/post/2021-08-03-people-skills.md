As a job title, “technical writer” only tells part of the story. Yes, we write technical content, but we also use people skills to facilitate the writing process. The road from undocumented project to comprehensive document suite is rarely smooth, and the user documentation is often de-prioritized when resources are scarce. That's why tech writers usually employ our people skills before we apply our fingertips to the keyboard.

Projects with the following features make the technical writer’s job relatively easy:
- Accessible design documents
- TOIs and demos
- Engaged subject matter experts
- Structured status meetings
- A well-planned schedule

These projects do exist. I've worked on several throughout the years. But they are rare, despite everyone’s efforts to make them the norm. Most projects have weaknesses (aggressive ship dates or overloaded development and QA engineers, for example) caused by external factors like customer demands or hurried project planning.

Even when a project is impeded by logistical challenges, the documentation must be written and published, and it must be accurate, complete, and on time. When the tech writer’s path to success is blocked by inaccessible subject matter experts and scant design documentation, our people skills help us plot a course through the obstacles.

Imagine you’re the tech writer for an upcoming software release that supports new parameters. There are no design docs describing the new parameters, no demo is scheduled, and the scheduled ship date is alarmingly close. So you ask the product manager, lead developer, and QA lead for a TOI. The product manager agrees. The dev lead does not respond. The QA lead says his team has no time to spare. At the TOI, the product manager describes the parameters at a high level and how they benefit the customer. You need more technical details to properly document the new parameters, so what does the path forward look like?

This is where the rubber meets the road in terms of a tech writer’s people skills. Fortunately, most of the tech writers I know, myself included, are sociable. We are word people, so we like to talk, and we even like to listen. In an office environment, we find colleagues who also enjoy conversing. We form rapports and friendships with them. And since tech writers interact frequently with engineers in a professional capacity, many of our professional friendships are with QA and development engineers.

When the tech writer has an easy rapport with an engineer, that engineer is almost always willing to receive and respond to a brief email, IM, or chat at their desk. The tech writer with good people skills will keep the exchange friendly, brief, and specific. For example, she could show up at the friendly engineer’s desk and ask for a complete rundown of all the new parameters … but that would put a lot of burden on the engineer. To make it easier for the engineer, the tech writer could ask about one parameter and share what she already knows, based on the TOI with the product manager. It’s easier for the SME to provide bite-sized answers than try to deliver a broad overview.

This is just one very simple example of how tech writers use people skills to do their jobs, but it illustrates the type of creativity, empathy, and awareness good tech writers utilize with every project. In the 20+ years I’ve been documenting software and hardware, I’ve often seen resource-starved projects de-prioritize the user documentation development until the last days of the schedule. As a result, the user docs live at the bottom of the priority list until the day before the ship date, when they catapult to the top. Even in that demanding scenario, a tech writer with good people skills finds or makes opportunities to get the information they need to complete the job, and delivers reviewed and approved documentation on time.
